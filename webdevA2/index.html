                                <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the free-standing bell tower (campanile) of the Cathedral of Pisa in Pisa, Italy. Famous for its almost four-degree tilt caused by unstable ground foundation, the 56-meter tall tower has become one of the most recognizable architectural icons in the world. Despite the tilt, the tower remains structurally sound and is seen by over 5 million visitors annually.</p>

                                <p>The tower was planned to be the bell tower for the adjacent Pisa Cathedral, part of the cathedral complex in the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Its purpose was both functional, to house the cathedral bells, and symbolic, as an expression of the wealth and power of the maritime Republic of Pisa during the Middle Ages.</p>

                                <p>The building began in 1173 under architect Bonanno Pisano, but the tower began to tilt during construction due to soft clay soil on one side of the foundation. Construction was halted many times over the nearly 200 years it took while engineers attempted to correct the lean. The tower wasn't finished until 1372, and widespread stabilization efforts in the late 20th century reduced its lean from 5.5 degrees to about 3.97 degrees.</p>
